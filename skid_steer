# Skid-Steer Robot

This folder contains modeling, control, and simulation files for a skid-steer mobile robot.

## Contents

### model/
Contains the mathematical model of the robot including:
- Kinematic equations
- Dynamic model
- Mass and inertia parameters

### controller/
Implements the nonlinear two-loop controller:
- Controller
- Lyapunov-based stability logic

### simulation/
Contains MATLAB scripts to:
- Simulate trajectory tracking
- Visualize robot pose and error convergence
- Plot control inputs and wheel torques

## Objective
To achieve stable trajectory tracking using full kinematic-dynamic modeling
and nonlinear control techniques.
